    "# Leak Detection with Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I show you how can be used Machine Learning algorithms for leak detection in water netwoks, this project can be dividided into the following parts.\n",

    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> Problem Analysis.</li>\n",
    "    <li> Tools to use.</li>\n",

    "<h2>Problem analysis</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common problem in water network systems are the losses generated by leak in pipes and junctions, this losses can be represent a huge percentege of the water produced in the generation plants, so this problem results in a deterioration of the environment and considerable costs, therefore, it is important to use the new technologies to resolve these type of problems.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In this project will be used differents Machine Learning Algoritms to solve the problem of lake detection in water networks systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Tools to use</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will be developed with wntr library from Python, wntr is a library to simulate water networks with Python, also, with this library it's possible to simulate the behavior of a water network system in presence of leaks of various sizes. Before to start with code development I will define what is a leak\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>What is a Leak?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "A leak is a loss of water in anywhere point of a water network system, the amount of water loss is proportional to the pressure in the system, meaning that high pressures in water networks generates greather losses of water, while with low pressures the water loss is lower.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "To develop the project is necessary a water network to leak simulation, in this project the water network to be used is a network that brings the documentation, named Net3.\n",
    "<img src=\"data/net3.png\">\n",
    "The image above show the water network that will be used for this project. "
