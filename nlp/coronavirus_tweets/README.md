# Tweet Classification

In this project I will show you how to use TensorFlow to implement a basic text classifier. The goal of this project is to classify tweets related with the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset can be downloaded from the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification)
 
## Running the notebook.

### Using Anaconda environment.

To run the provided notebook you need to create a new anaconda environment. You can create a new environment with all the libraries required using the coronavirus_tweets.yml file and run the following line:

    conda env create -f coronavirus_tweets.yml
    conda activate activate coronavirus_tweets

After activating the environment you can run the jupyter notebook.
