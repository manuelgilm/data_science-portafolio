# Bike Sharing

The Bike Sharing project is a regression analysis project that aims to predict the demand for bike rentals based on various factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and other relevant features. The project involves analyzing a dataset of bike sharing records and building a regression model to accurately predict the number of bike rentals.

The Dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset).

This dataset contains the hourly and daily count of rental bikes between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital bikeshare system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information.
